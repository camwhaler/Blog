Welcome to my blog. I don't really have much to put here and I only really intend to use it to post tutorials and a few other things. I've added more games to the site and if anyone's interested I will have a tutorial on how to run linux based emulators on your chromebook. Stay tuned.

By the way, to access the navigation bar move your mouse to the left edge of the page.
